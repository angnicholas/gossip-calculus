\title{Gossip Calculus - A Work in Progress}

\maketitle

TODO: figure out the formatting 

Get rid of the indent and make it such that an enter actually makes a gap

Take the neurips template or sth

\section{Motivation}
I want to model the way knowledge is transferred in gossip-style conversations.

A minimal example. If I (Alice) told you (Bob) that Charlie is attached to Deborah, you (Bob) now know that Charlie is attached to Deborah but you also know that I (Alice) know that Charlie is attached to Deborah.

\subsection{Uses}
It may be the case that the exact inference rules of the calculus may differ depending on our objective

\begin{itemize}
\item Minimal approximation: When is it safe for me to talk about something (which could otherwise constitute privileged information) to someone? - if I know that the person has the information

\item Maximal approximation: If I have a secret (eg about myself), and I want to know the maximum set of people who could potentially already know about this

\end{itemize}

\section{Preliminaries}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{For now, we assume that no one is lying.} If a liar tells me X I basically haven't gained much... apart from the fact that I can prove the liar knows X if I knew X is true from a trusted source. In the future, we could potentially extend the calculus further to have sets of people who tell the truth and sets of people who might lie, (maybe even with probabilities),

\item We assume that there is a \textbf{global continuous time that moves forward in one direction}, although people might refer to events with certain \textbf{intervals} of that timeline (eg. I know about event X, but event X could have happened at any time between $(-\infty, t_2]$),

\item We \textbf{don't care about epistemological issues}, or the JTB definition of knowledge (eg. if I know X, do I know that I know X???) Our model of Alice's knowledge will just be a box called Alice, and inside is a whole bunch of facts / propositions, and if Alice tells Bob something then Bob adds a bunch of propositions into his box, etc.,

\item Generally we will use letters earlier in the alphabet for people and letters later in the alphabet for events / facts,

\item If the parentheses don't make sense at any point, try to read them as Mathematical parentheses rather than English parentheses. 


\end{enumerate}

\section{Some Principles that the Calculus Must Obey}

\subsection{Conversation Builds an Infinite Knowledge Chain}
When A tells B something, eg X, 

A must know X $X \in A$ \\

Now B knows X $X \in B$ \\

But A also knows that B knows X, cos she told him: $(X \in B) \in A$ \\

And B knows that A knows X, if not how would she have told him: $(X \in A) \in B$ \\

And B, being a rational agent, can deduce the previous fact, so $((X \in B) \in A) \in B$. \\

Etc... \\

Definition 1 (figure out how to Latex the definitions later) \\

Therefore, we can define the infinite series $A \rightarrow^X B = X \in A \wedge X \in B \wedge (X \in B) \in A ...$ \\

which arises when someone tells someone something \\
